            <li>General Submission:
                <ul>
                    <li>Does the page link directly to the review or provide a primary page with links? <strong>Yes</strong></li>
                    <li>Are file and folder names free of spaces and uppercase letters (e.g., scripts, images)? <strong>Yes</strong></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Design:
                <ul>
                    <li>Is there sufficient contrast and appropriate font sizing for readability? 
                        <strong>Yes</strong>, the site uses visually appealing colors, the logo complements the site's aesthetic, and the font is well-chosen for readability.
                    </li>
                    <li>Are consistent site colors and fonts applied via a standard `.css` file? <strong>Yes</strong></li>
                    <li>Are CRAP (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity) principles followed? 
                        <strong>Yes</strong>, although not all content is present yet. Based on the visible elements, spacing, contrast, alignment, and proximity have been carefully considered to enhance user navigation and readability.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Main Content:
                <ul>
                    <li>Does the main content start with the page name in an `h2` (not the site/brand name)? 
                        <strong>No</strong> I think it's still not complete yet
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Footer:
                <ul>
                    <li>Does the footer include a menu linking to the userâ€™s pages? <strong>Not Yet</strong></li>
                    <li>Are HTML and CSS validation tools (e.g., Accumulus) included? <strong>Yes</strong>Accumulus is included</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Feedback:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stop:</strong> I would say stop delaying the completion too much as the site is not completed when it;s being reviewed</li>
                    <li><strong>Start:</strong>I would start working on finishing it ASAP</li>
                    <li><strong>Continue:</strong> The overall theme looks good with clear ideas</li>
                </ul>
